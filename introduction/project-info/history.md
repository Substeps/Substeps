History
=======

Substeps was started by Ian Moore in 2011 with the support and encouragement from his employer at the time, Technophobia.  The first open source release occurred in July 2012, with regular(ish) releases from then on.

Fast forward to mid 2015 when Ian had left Technophobia (now known as G2G3.digital).  With releases now few and far between and merge requests unresolved, Ian decided to fork the original repository and release under 
a new groupId, substeps.org and provide a new set of documentation that could be more easily maintained.
